This script converts files of JWPCE entries so they can be imported into Anki.

Basically I've entered Japanese words into JWPCE in order to look up the
defenitions, saved those to files and now want to put them into the Anki
flashcard program.

Ideally I'll set something up to read lists of words directly into csv files.
But, for now at least, it's easier to type things out in JWPCE and do searches
there, than the alternatives I've found.
